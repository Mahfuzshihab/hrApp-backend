## Personal Reflection  
Every project offers a learning opportunity. This project helped me to improve my React skills, especially state management, hooks and axios. Backend with json-server and deploying both frontend and backend taught me real-world app setup and environment configuration. I started doing this very lately, in the end of summer vacation. Certainly I enjoyed the hr app journey.
