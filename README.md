# HR App

## Project Description  
HR App is a React based web tool for managing employee information with features to list, add, and edit employees. It connects to a `json-server` backend to simulate a real database, uses React hooks for state and effects, and offers a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Project Steps and Features

**Step 1:** Created the React app with core components — Header, Footer, and PersonCard — and initialized Git. Styled components and pushed the initial setup.

**Step 3:** Built pages for About, PersonList, and AddEmployee, added navigation, and managed form state to add employees. Lifted employee state to App and added logic for employee service years and emoji display.

**Step 4:** Set up a `json-server` backend with `db.json` and connected the frontend via Axios to fetch and update employee data, ensuring persistence.

**Step 5:** Added edit functionality inside PersonCard with fields like salary and location editable. Implemented PATCH requests to update backend and updated local state without full refetch.

**Step 6:** Refactored code and components, created a custom `useAxios` hook, and applied consistent styling. Deployed backend on Render and frontend on Vercel with live API URL updates.

## Personal Reflection  
This project improved my React skills, especially state management and component design. Integrating a backend with `json-server` deepened my understanding of asynchronous data and server communication. Deploying both frontend and backend taught me valuable lessons in real-world app setup and environment configuration. i started doing this very lately, in the end of summer vacation. Certainly i enjoyed the hr app journey.
